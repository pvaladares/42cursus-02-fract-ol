# Tips

The [`minilibx-linux.tgz`](https://projects.intra.42.fr/uploads/document/document/9230/minilibx-linux.tgz) has some man pages, the other versions don't have!

In order to convert from `man` format to `pdf`, use command `man -Tpdf man > man.pdf` as suggested [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/444769).
