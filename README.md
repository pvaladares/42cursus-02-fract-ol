Discover 2D programming and the psychedelic universe of fractals in this project, using minilibX.

# Tips

- The [`minilibx-linux.tgz`](files/minilibx-linux.tgz) has some man pages that are not in the other provided compressed files.

## Converting from `man` to `pdf`
- In order to convert from `man` format to `pdf`, use command `man -Tpdf man > man.pdf` as suggested [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/444769).

## Installing permanently the `mlx` man pages
- Use command `manpath` to list all the folders where `man` will look for files
- Copy the files into one of the folders listed
```shell
sudo cp minilibx-linux/man/man3/* /usr/local/man/man3
```
- Now just type `man mlx` to check the manual
```man
MiniLibX(3)                             Library Functions Manual                            MiniLibX(3)
